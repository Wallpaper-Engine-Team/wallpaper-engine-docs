# SceneScript Class IEngine

You can access this interface at any point in your scripts via the `engine` global to retrieve general information about the system of the wallpaper user and the running wallpaper.

[[toc]]

## Properties

### screenResolution: Vec2

The size of the screen the wallpaper is displayed on.

### canvasSize: Vec2

The size of the wallpaper project defined in the editor. Only for 2D scenes.

### userProperties: Object

Access to the user properties and the values currently selected by the user. Color properties are converted to Vec3 automatically.

### timeOfDay: Number

The time of day in the range [0.00, 1.00] representing the 24h clock. This means that 00:00:00 is represented as 0.00 and 23:59:59 is represented by a value of 1.00.

### frametime: Number

Time it took to update the last frame. This property is useful as it allows you to create create animations with a normalized speed. If create any sort of animation with SceneScript, it will have a different speed for users with a different FPS limit unless you first normalize it with `engine.frametime`.

### runtime: Number

Total time in seconds that the wallpaper has been running.

::: danger Please Note
The runtime has a rollover to retain floating point precision. If you want to create a timer, consider using `setTimeout();` instead.

## Constants

### AUDIO\_RESOLUTION\_16: Number

Use this as a parameter in `registerAudioBuffers()` to create an [AudioBuffers](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/AudioBuffers) object with **16** frequency bands.

### AUDIO\_RESOLUTION\_32: Number

Use this as a parameter in `registerAudioBuffers()` to create an [AudioBuffers](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/AudioBuffers) object with **32** frequency bands.

### AUDIO\_RESOLUTION\_64: Number

Use this as a parameter in `registerAudioBuffers()` to create an [AudioBuffers](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/AudioBuffers) object with **64** frequency bands.

## Functions

### isDesktopDevice(): Boolean

Returns `true` on the Wallpaper Engine PC app and `false` on mobile devices.

### isMobileDevice(): Boolean

Returns `true` on the Wallpaper Engine mobile app and `false` on PCs.

### isWallpaper(): Boolean

Returns `true` when the wallpaper is being used as a wallpaper (as opposed to being used as a screensaver).

### isScreensaver(): Boolean

Returns `true` when the wallpaper is being used as a screensaver (as opposed to being used as a wallpaper).

### isPortrait(): Boolean

Returns true if the screen uses a portrait resolution.

### isLandscape(): Boolean

Returns true if the screen uses a landscape resolution.

### isRunningInEditor(): Boolean

You can use this to check whether the script is currently running inside the editor or not.

### registerAudioBuffers(resolution: Number): AudioBuffers

Registers your script with the audio responsive system in Wallpaper Engine and get access to the current audio volume levels of the user. The `resolution` parameter is required and defines in how many parts the audio spectrum is subdivided. To conserve memory and performance, you should always stick to the lowest number that you actually need.

Valid values for the `resolution` parameter are `engine.AUDIO_RESOLUTION_16`, `engine.AUDIO_RESOLUTION_32` and `engine.AUDIO_RESOLUTION_64` which divide the audio spectrum into 16, 32 and 64 sections respectively.

Returns an [AudioBuffers](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/AudioBuffers) object that you can store to retrieve the audio volume levels in each rendered frame.

### registerAsset(file: String): IAssetHandle

If you create any layers dynamically with SceneScript, use function this to mark an asset as being used by your wallpaper. This is important for releasing a wallpaper to the Workshop, as only used or marked assets will be included in the scene archive that is generated.

### setTimeout(callback: Function, delay?: Number): Function

Starts a timeout callback in milliseconds. Returns a new callback that can be used to stop the timeout prematurely.

### setInterval(callback: Function, delay?: Number): Function

Starts a repeating interval callback in milliseconds. Returns a new callback that can be used to stop the interval.
