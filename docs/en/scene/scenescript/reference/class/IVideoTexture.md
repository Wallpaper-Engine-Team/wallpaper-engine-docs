# SceneScript Class IVideoTexture

This class represents a video texture. Video textures are `.mp4` video files which are rendered similar to an image layer texture. Objects of this class allow you to control a video texture and read its current playback state. Using the `addEndedCallback` function, you can attach custom logic which is executed after the video has reached its end.

Not to be confused with [ITextureAnimation](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/ITextureAnimation).
