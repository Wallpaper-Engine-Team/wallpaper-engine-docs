## Functions

### getLayer(name: String|Number): ILayer

Get a layer by index or custom name.

### getLayerCount(): Number

Get the total layer count.

### enumerateLayers(): ILayer[]

Get all layers in an array.

### destroyLayer(name: String|Number|ILayer): Boolean

Remove a layer by index, name or reference. The layer will actually be removed in a deferred manner so consider this when expecting scripts to stop or destroy on that layer.

### createLayer(configuration: String|Object|IAssetHandle): ILayer

Creates a new layer and returns a reference to it. The configuration can simply be a path to the asset relative to the project, a custom object just like in the `scene.json` file itself with any overrides you want or an [IAssetHandle](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IAssetHandle) returned by `engine.registerAsset()`.

### sortLayer(layer: String|Number|ILayer, index: Number): Boolean

Changes the display order of a layer.

### getLayerIndex(layer: String|ILayer): Number

Returns the current index of a layer in the scene graph.

### getInitialLayerConfig(layer: String|Number|ILayer): Object;

Get the initial configuration of an existing layer.

### getCameraTransforms(): CameraTransforms

Returns the current, static camera transforms. Do not use this while using a camera path!

### setCameraTransforms(cameraTransforms: CameraTransforms): void

Changes the current, static camera transforms. Do not use this while using a camera path!
