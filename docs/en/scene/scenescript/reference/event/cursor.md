# SceneScript Cursor Events

SceneScript offers multiple cursor event that allows you to interact with mouse movements and mouse clicks. The parameter for all cursor events is an [CursorEvent](/scene/scenescript/reference/class/CursorEvent) object with additional event data.

All mouse cursor events will only work on objects marked as **Solid** in the layer settings.
