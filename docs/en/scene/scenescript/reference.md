# SceneScript Reference

SceneScript is follows the ECMAScript 2018 specification, so you can utilize all functionalities from ECMAScript that you would also find in similar languages such as *JavaScript*. This is very useful as you can make use of various helpful classes. For example, `Date` allows you to access the current date and time, `Math` allows you to access various mathematical utility functions.

This page only covers all additions that SceneScript adds to make working with wallpapers possible.

## Globals

SceneScript introduces a handful of globals which you can access at any point in your code.

| Global        | Description   |
|---------------|---------------|
| [engine](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IEngine.html) | Access to general features of the application. `IEngine` class. |
| [input](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IInput.html) | Input related data, mainly the mouse cursor. `IInput` class.|
| [thisScene](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IScene.html) | The currently loaded scene wallpaper. `IScene` class |
| [thisLayer](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/ILayer.html) | The layer this script has been loaded on. `ILayer` class. |
| [thisObject](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IThisPropertyObject.html) | The object this script belongs to. `IThisPropertyObject` class. |
| [console](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/IConsole.html) | Access the console log for debugging purposes. `IConsole` class. |
| [shared](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/class/Shared.html) | Empty by default, allows you to share data between multiple scripts. `Shared` class. |

## Events

SceneScript uses an event system that allows you to run specific code whenever certain events take place. Most notably, the `update` event is most commonly used to execute SceneScript code at every frame that Wallpaper Engine calculates. The `init` event is good for running code once when the wallpaper is first loaded and the `applyUserProperties` event allows you to react to changes to user properties of your wallpaper. Additionally, there are a handful of `cursor` events which related to mouse movement and mouse input which you can incorporate into your wallpaper.

| Event                | Description   |
|----------------------|---------------|
| [init](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/init.html) | This initialization function will be called once after the object it belongs to has been created. |
| [update](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/update.html) | This event function will be called every frame for all scripts that export it. |
| [destroy](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/destroy.html) | This event function will be called just before the object it belongs to gets destroyed. |
| [resizeScreen](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/resizeScreen.html) | This function will be called every time the wallpaper resizes because of a change to the current resolution. |
| [applyUserProperties](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/applyUserProperties.html) | Contains up-to-date values for user properties. This event function will be called once initially when the wallpaper is loaded and whenever any user properties are being adjusted by the user. |
| [applyGeneralSettings](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/applyGeneralSettings.html) | Contains general app settings (currently only language). This event function will be called once initially when the wallpaper is loaded and whenever any general app settings are adjusted by the user. |

| [cursorLeave](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor.html) | This event function will be called when the cursor leaves the bounds of the object. |
| [cursorMove](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor.html) | This event function will be called when the cursor has been moved. |

| [cursorUp](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor.html) | This event function will be called when the cursor is being released over an object.  |
| [cursorClick](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/cursor.html) | This event function will be called when the cursor has been pressed and released on the same object. |
| [mediaStatusChanged](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media.html) | This event function will be called when the media integration is turned on or off by the user. |
| [mediaPlaybackChanged](/en/scene/scenescript/reference/event/media.html) | This event function will be called when the users starts, stops or pauses media. |
