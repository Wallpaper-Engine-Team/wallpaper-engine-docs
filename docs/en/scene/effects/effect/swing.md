# Swing Effect

The **Swing** effect allows you to swing part of an image back and forth. You can change the direction, the strength and the smoothness through the effect settings.

### Effect Settings

* **Double-sided:** Extends the effect towards the top of the effect area as if the area was swinging like a see-saw.
* **Noise:** Allows you to add random movements to the effect.
* **Amount:** The overall strength of the effect.
* **Center:** The point around which the effect swings.
* **Feather:** Strength in which the effect is smoothed into surrounding areas of the image.
* **Time offset:** Adds a small delayed start to the effect, this can be useful if you are using the effect multiple times throughout your wallpaper and want to ensure they are not synchronized.
* **p0:** Top-left corner of the effect area.
* **p1:** Top-right corner of the effect area.
* **Size:** The distance from **p0** and **p1**.
* **Speed:** The speed at which the effect swings back and forth.
