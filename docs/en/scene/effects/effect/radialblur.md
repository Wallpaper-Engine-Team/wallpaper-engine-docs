# Radial Blur Effect

The radial blur effect allows you to generate a circular motion blur effect around a specific point of a given layer.

### Effect Settings

* **Kernel size:** The size of the filter kernel. A larger kernel makes the image more blurry but also requires more system performance.
* **Blur alpha:** Will also consider the alpha channel for the blur operation.
* **Opacity mask:** You can draw this mask to determine what areas of your image the effect is applied to.
* **Center:** The center point around which the blur is applied. You can use the crosshair symbol to manually place the center point with the left mouse button.
* **Scale:** Controls the amount of the circular blur.
