# Cloud Motion Effect

The **Cloud Motion** effect adds a cloud motion to certain parts of the image. You can customize the direction through the effect settings and limit the effect to certain parts of the image via the opacity mask.

If your clouds are very close to other objects, it might help to place the clouds on a separate image layer. When drawing the opacity mask, make sure to add some distance around the clouds and keep distance to other objects to prevent unwanted image distortions.

### Effect Settings

* **Opacity mask:** The opacity mask allows you to limit the effect to only certain parts of the image.
* **Perlin noise:** A customizable noise mask which adds elements of randomness to the effect.
* **Amount:** The perceived strength of the effect.
* **Direction:** The direction of the cloud movement.
* **Granularity:** Higher values make the effect appear finer and smaller.
* **Horizontal granularity:** An additional way to tweak the horizontal refinement of the effect.
* **Speed:** The speed at which the cloud motion appears.
