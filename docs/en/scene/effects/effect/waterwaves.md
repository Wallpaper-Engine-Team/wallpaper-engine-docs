The **Water Waves** applies a wave animation to the image that works well for water, clothes and hair animations.

### Effect Settings

* **Dual waves:** Adds a second wave to the animation which changes the effect to an alternative look and feel. You can configure the second wave independently from the first wave at the bottom of the effect settings.
* **Perspective rendering:** Allows you to set four points to create the create a perceived perspective of the effect.
* **Opacity mask:** You can draw this mask to determine what areas of your image the effect is applied to.
* **Time offset mask:** Allows you to add a delay to certain parts of the effect. Useful for making sure multiple objects are not all moving in sync, which often looks unrealistic.
* **Strength:** Control how much the image is distorted by the wave.

### Wave settings

* **Direction:** The direction of the waves.
* **Exponent:** Changes the overall shape of the wave with a bias for lower or higher waves.
* **Offset:** Only for the second wave when the **Dual wave** option is enabled. Adds a delay to the second wave to remove synchronization from the first and second wave.
* **Scale:** Sets the frequency of the waves.
* **Speed:** Defines how fast the waves animate.
