# Shimmer Effect

The **Shimmer** effect allows you to run a line of light across your image in a certain direction.

### Effect Settings

* **Blend mode:** Determines the way in which the effect is blended into the image.
* **Style:** Allows you to change between a linear and a mirrored (back-and-forth) behavior.
* **Opacity mask:** The opacity mask allows you to limit the effect to only certain parts of the image.
* **Time offset:** Allows you to draw a mask where the shimmering light moves at a different speed. Once you add this time offset map to your effect, the **Timescale** option will appear further down in the effect settings.
* **Gradient map:** Defines the appearance of the light shimmer. Click on **Browse** to view alternate versions that you can use. Ideally the gradient map for this effect is black and white.
* **Brightness:** The strength of the shimmer of light.
* **Color:** The color of the light.
* **Delay:** Defines the time scale between light shimmers.
* **Direction:** The direction in which the light shimmer moves.
* **Granularity:** The refinement of the light shimmer, higher values result in a smaller shimmer.
* **Offset:** A time offset, this is useful if you have multiple shimmers of light and want them to start with a slight delay between each other.
* **Speed:** The speed of the light shimmer movement.
* **Timescale:** Only visible when a time offset map has been drawn in the effect settings above. Defines the scale at which time is distorted through the time offset map.
