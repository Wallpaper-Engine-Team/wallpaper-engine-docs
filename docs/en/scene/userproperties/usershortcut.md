# User Shortcut Property

The user shortcut property is a special type of user property since it does not directly alter the look-and-feel of the wallpaper itself. Instead, it allows users themselves to define a shortcut to a file, directory, web page or console command. The shortcuts can be triggered only through a click event in [*SceneScript*](/en/scene/scenescript/introduction.html), which makes this feature reserved for more advanced users.

We recommend using this feature only when it really fits the purpose of the wallpaper. Wallpaper Engine is primarily a wallpaper tool and ordinary wallpapers should not be overloaded with user shortcuts.

::: warning Good to know
For security reasons, user shortcuts are bound to a specific system. They cannot be shared across computers and they are ignored as part of wallpaper presets. Users always need to manually configure these shortcuts per system.
